The following technologies were utilized to make this app: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Handlebars, AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Google fonts.

  This is an app that has a very niche utility - to allow the user to save albums that he/she listens to over a period of time to reference in the future when he/she is ready to purchase the saved album. I wanted to create this app because as I listen to music at places like Spotify and YouTube I am constantly finding music that I like and would want to purchase. However, nearly every time I walk into a music store I draw a blank to which albums I wanted to purchase. Hopefully this concept will help remedy that problem. 

  In order to create this app I started with both a front and back end template. The front end template contained authorization functions, several AJAX functions, configuration files, and a template index.html file. The backend template contained configuration files, a pre-made user resource and example models, controllers, and serializers created using Ruby on Rails. Next, my goal was to fully create my backend so I could focus on linking my front end to my backend resources. To do this I created an Album resource that would contain all of my album information associated with each user. After the Album resource and associated CRUD actions were created and functioning properly I created a one to many association between the User and Album models. Next, I created a Comment resource and linked it to my User resource using a one to many relationship and also to my Albums resource using a one to many relationship. Once my backend was completed I then decided to work on my front end and link it to my backend so I could perform CRUD actions on the browser.
  
  Everything that I set out to do on this app I accomplished and did not encounter any major problems while developing this app. However if I were to continue building this app one extra feature I would want would be to allow users to view other user's saved albums and to comment on each album. I would also like to create a rating system that could rate albums based on how much you want it or how you liked it when you originally listened to it.
